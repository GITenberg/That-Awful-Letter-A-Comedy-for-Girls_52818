<small>By Edna Randolph Worrell.</small></div>


<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The music
is easy, and both music and words are especially catchy. Children like
them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price 25 cents each. Five
copies, $1.00.</p>

<p><b>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</b> A
welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous frame of
mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the success of
your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music, catchy.</p>

<p><b>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</b> This beautiful song
has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and singers. It is just
the song to send your audience home with happy memories of the occasion.</p>

<p><b>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</b> This song
will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful school days.
Words, unusually clever. Music, decidedly melodious. A capital welcome
song, or it may be sung at any time on the program with assured success.</p>

<p><b>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE THEE.</b> A song that will bring
a thrill of patriotism to the heart of every one who hears it. The children
and grown-ups just can’t resist the catchy music. It makes a capital
marching song.</p>

<p><b>COME AND PARTAKE OF OUR WELCOME CAKE.</b> A merry
welcome song and a jolly one, too. The audience will be immediately
curious about the Welcome Cake, and the children will love to surprise
the listeners with the catchy words. Music, easy and tuneful.</p>

<p><b>LULLABY LANE.</b> The music and words blend so beautifully that
people will be humming the appealing strains long after they hear this
charming song. A wonderfully effective closing song, whether sung by
the school or as a solo by a little girl, with a chorus of other little girls
with dolls.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</b> Words by Elizabeth F. Guptill. Music
by Edna R. Worrell. This spicy coon song will bring down the house,
especially if you use the directions for the motions which accompany the
music. The black faces and shining eyes of the pickaninnies will guarantee
a hit. The words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><b>THE LITTLE BIRD’S SECRET.</b> Here is just the song for those
two little folks to sing together. They won’t have to be coaxed to sing
it, especially when they find that the whole school is to whistle the chorus.
This is a decided novelty, and will prove a rare treat to your audience.</p>

<p><b>A GARDEN ROMANCE.</b> This is a dainty little song telling of the
romance and wedding of Marigold and Sweet William. It is just the
song for dainty little girls to sing.</p>

<p><b>COME TO THE NURSERY RHYME GARDEN AND PLAY.</b>
Here is something different for the little folks to sing. The Nursery
Rhyme Folk are so familiar to children, it will be no trick for them to
remember the words. The music has a most captivating swing.</p>

<h2>SCENE I</h2>


<p>(<i>Sitting-room in Neilson’s house, well furnished. Margaret
overdressed, is sitting reading a magazine. She looks
up impatiently and throws it down in disgust.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>crossly.</i>) There’s no use in my trying to
read or do anything else when I’m so provoked. I don’t see
why dad can’t (<i>the bell rings</i>) Oh, drat that bell! I don’t
want to see any person. I wish people would stay at home.
(<i>Goes and looks out.</i>) Oh! it’s Helen! I wonder what she
wants now. She is always running over and I’m sure I’m
never over there any more than four times a day at the most.
(<i>Helen comes in and Margaret rushes to embrace her.</i>) Oh
Helen, you dear girl! I’m so glad to see you. I was just
wishing you would come over. Do take off your hat and
stay awhile. I’ve just been so mad I could boil over or bite
somebody or do something awful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Why, what is the matter with you? What are you
mad about? (<i>Aside, It seems to me she is always in hot
water or a stew about something.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Well, sit down and I’ll tell you about it.
(<i>They sit down on a couch.</i>) It seems that dad has some
country relations somewhere in the backwoods. He’s had
them ever since he was born but he’s just remembering
them now. Well, it seems that there’s a girl about my age
and dad was looking over some old photos last night and
came across one of her when she was six years old. That
picture put him into the notion that he would like to see
that girl and nothing will do but I must write and ask her up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—That won’t hurt you, will it? I think it would
be nice to have a girl visiting you. I know when Marian
Staddon was visiting me, we had a dandy time—parties,
dances, and heaps of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Yes, but can’t you get anything into your
head? This is a cousin from the <i>backwoods</i> and just imagine
the kind of figure she’d cut in our set! Why, she’ll likely
have the oddest clothes and speak most horrible English and,
and—not know beans. And then that would spoil all our
plans for getting in with Edith Browning. The Brownings,
you know, are such an aristocratic family and are the
whole cheese since they moved to the city. I’m just crazy
to get in with them, but of course if they saw me with that
girl, that would spoil everything. Edith would know that
my father had sprung from common ordinary farmers and
we have just succeeded in making people think we had very
important ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside</i>) Gee! but isn’t she some snob. Well,
nobody is deceived I can vouch for that. (<i>aloud.</i>) I know
Edith Browning is the whole thing just at present. I’ve met
her several times and think she is lovely, (<i>pause</i>) not a bit
stuck up, you know. Of course we want to get in with her,
especially this winter when Beth Norton is going to visit her,
for everybody will be having parties and things for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—And pray, who is Beth Norton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Don’t you know? Why, she is the girl that all the
girls at Erskine College were just crazy about. Why, they
say there’s never been a girl there before who was as popular.
And act! Why, she took the chief parts in all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
plays and the girls said she had any professional actress
beaten all to pieces. Oh yes, we must manage to get in
with them if we can. Now about your cousin, say, why
can’t you have her up for just a couple of days and keep her
out of the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Dad is bound that I’ll invite her up for two
weeks anyway. I can generally manage him pretty well,
but this time he’s as obstinate as a mule. I’m glad I didn’t
inherit his bad qualities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside</i>) I think she has all of his and some of
her own to boot, (<i>aloud</i>) I have an idea. Write her such
a letter that if she has any sense at all she’ll know she’s not
wanted and then perhaps she won’t come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>jumping up</i>) That <i>is</i> a good idea! Let’s
write it now. What shall we put into it? (<i>goes to a table
where there is paper and ink, sits down to write</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>going to the table</i>) Tell her that,—oh, I don’t
know. You ought to be good at that sort of thing. (<i>Margaret
looks up sharply</i>). Writing letters I mean. You can
write such splendid ones, you know. (<i>Margaret writes
awhile while Helen looks over her shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>rising</i>) There, that ought to do the trick.
What do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Well, if she can’t take the hint from that that
she’s not wanted, she must be as dense as a—a fog! (<i>goes
to put on her hat.</i>) I must go for I promised to stay only a
few minutes. Good-bye (<i>goes towards the door</i>) I hope
your cousin won’t be too boorish if she does come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Good-bye. We’ll trust to luck. (<i>Helen disappears.
Margaret comes to centre of stage</i>) Well, that
letter <i>is</i> a good stunt, but my, wouldn’t dad be angry if he
knew! But I’ll chance it that he doesn’t find out. Now for
a toast. (<i>Pretends to drink.</i>) Here’s to the refusal of my
invitation to my country cousin.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>SCENE II</h2>


<p>(<i>A country kitchen. Elizabeth in middy and skirt, enters
slowly toward centre of stage, examining an envelope.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>still examining envelope.</i>) I wonder who
this letter’s from. I don’t know the writing and it’s from
New York City. But there’s lot of people I know there. Perhaps
it’s from one of those little girls at Erskine College that
were always getting a crush on us bigger girls and bothering
us to death with their gushing. Now, who is it from anyway?
(<i>laughing.</i>) Say, I never thought of it, but perhaps if I
opened it I’d find out. (<i>Opens and glances over it, and seems
amazed and reads very slowly aloud.</i>)</p>

Dear Cousin Elizabeth:<br />
</div>

<p>Father wished me to write and ask you to visit us for a
couple of weeks. I know that you really wouldn’t want to
come as you’d feel so shy and awkward in a city home and
among the girls in our set and doubtless you have no clothes
suitable for the city; but as he wished me to ask you, I
have done so.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours truly,</span><br />
Margaret Neilson.<br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>Elizabeth looks up bewildered.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—What a queer letter! I wonder if any of
the girls are playing a trick on me. (<i>thinks.</i>) Now, I have it.
I’ve heard mother mention her brother, Jerry Neilson, who
went to the city and his aristocratic wife made him cut his
country relations when they got rich. So this must be from
my cousin. But how could any girl write such a rude, insolent
letter like that! She certainly was forced to write
against her will. I bet her father never saw that letter. It
would serve her right if I sent it to him. I’d feel out of
place in a city home and in her set! Well, (<i>laughing</i>) that’s
a joke, when I’ve been in some of the best homes in New
York City. I wonder what Edith Browning would say to
that and a lot of the other girls at dear old Erskine. Well,
my dear cousin, I’ll just write you a polite note of refusal.</p>

<p>(<i>Goes to table and writes, then reads aloud</i>).</p>

<p>“Miss Edith Norton regrets with pleasure the sincerely
cordial and hospitable invitation of Miss Margaret Neilson.”
Oh, (<i>suddenly jumping and clapping her hands.</i>) I’ve an
idea! I’ll accept my kind and hospitable cousin’s invitation
since she’s so anxious to have me and since she expects me
to be such a queer freak from the backwoods, it would be
too bad to disappoint her, so I’ll dress and act the part of
the poor country cousin she’s looking for. Oh, (<i>dancing
around</i>) it will be heaps of fun. I’ll stay there a day and
then I’ll pay Edith Browning that visit I’ve promised her
for ages. (<i>Going towards the exit.</i>) The girls at Erskine
always said I was a born actress and now I’ll have the
chance to prove whether they were just flattering me or
not. (<i>Stops and glances at the address, 14 Riverside Drive.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Why, Mildred Ewing lives just a couple houses from there.
I’ll dress there and just slip over when the coast is clear.
There’s some of my masquerade costumes up in the attic.
I’ll run and see if I can find something suitable for my new
role. Say, but won’t I lead my dear cousin a merry dance!

<p>(<i>Sitting room in Neilson’s house. Margaret is seated doing
fancywork. Helen comes in and Margaret rushes to meet
her.</i>)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Say, what’s up now that you had to have me
come over in such a hurry? Have you any startling news?
(<i>Both go towards centre.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Oh Helen, I’m in a terrible fix and all over
that awful letter you made me write to—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>interrupting indignantly.</i>) I made you write!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Yes, to Elizabeth—or Lizzie as I guess she’s
called. Would you ever think she’d accept that invitation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—No, she hasn’t, has she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Yes, she has and here’s her answer. (<i>shows
her a letter written on some very brightly colored paper or
wrapping paper.</i>) Just look at the spelling and the style!
Wouldn’t it crimp you? And just wait until I read it to you
(<i>begins to read, while Helen follows her over her shoulder

Dear Maggie—(<i>Isn’t that abominable?</i>)—<br />
</div>

<p>I’ve been wanting ter visit the city ever since I was skin
high to a grasshopper, but didn’t know I had any kin in the
city that I could visit. It’s awferlly kind of youse to ask
me and I’ll be there as sure as guns this coming Wednesday.
I jest got some new clothes made by Susannah Sparks and
they’re mighty stylish, I kin tell yer. I aint a bit bashful so
youse kin invite all the people in youse like. I’d like ter meet
yer friends awful well. Remember me to yer pap.</p>

<p>(<i>throws the letter down on the table in disgust and makes
a face.</i>) Isn’t that perfectly awful? That means she’ll be
here to-morrow and oh, she must be dreadful! And what if
she should tell dad about that awful letter we wrote! Oh,
why did I do it, and whatever will I do? (<i>Sinks down in
chair and begins to cry.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>going over and putting her arm around her.</i>)
Oh, cheer up! Things might be worse. You can manage to
avoid the girls for awhile and you can give Lizzie books to
read or something to keep her in the background and out of
mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>drying her eyes.</i>) It’s a good thing she isn’t
coming today for you know I’ve invited Edith Browning
for tea and I want to be on my best behavior and be as nice
as I can so as to make a good impression. If Lizzie were
here, I would be mortified to death. (<i>bell rings behind
stage.</i>) Oh, there’s the bell. It’s too early for Edith. I
wonder who it is. (<i>goes to the door and looks out.</i>) There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Nora answering the door now. (<i>throws up her hands in
horror.</i>) Good heavens, who can that awful person be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—What person? (<i>Goes and looks too and giggles.</i>)
Goodness, I bet she’s escaped from some asylum. But
listen, Nora’s going to settle her. (<i>both listen at door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nora</span>—(<i>behind the scenes</i>) Yez can’t come in here. This
is no place for the likes of ye. Ye’d better thry the asylum
where ye belong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>behind the scenes</i>) Yer’d better go there
yerself. Let me tell yer that I kin come in if I want ter. I’ve
come to visit my Uncle Jerry and yer needn’t think a red-haired
freckled flip of a thing like yer can stop me. Now
stop making a door of yerself and let me through or I’ll tell
my cousin Maggie on yer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Good heavens, here she comes! (<i>Drags Margaret
to front of stage where they both fall limp into chairs.</i>)</p>

fashion and carries an old-fashioned telescope and a big
satchel. Both girls sit staring at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>Rushing up to them and throwing down
her telescope</i>) Helloa, girls! Be one of youse my cousin
Maggie? I’m Lizzie Norton. I got a chance ter come up a
day earlier so I didn’t think it would make any odds. (<i>The
girls have jumped to their feet thunder-struck.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>looks from one to the other</i>) Say, what’s

I’m <i>Margaret</i> Neilson so I suppose you must be my cousin
Lizzie. We were not expecting you until to-morrow. (<i>Aside

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside to Margaret</i>) Well, I should say! And
her clothes sure are the latest style as there’s never been any
like them—yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>tugging at the elastic on her hat</i>) Well,
youse didn’t tell me ter take off my hat, but I guess I’ll make
myself ter hum. (<i>Takes off her hat and throws it on the
couch and stares around.</i>) My, aint everything here perfectly
grand! (<i>Goes around the room.</i>) Youse folks must be
pretty stylish. Now, ter home us folks aint never seen such
nice things. (<i>Turns suddenly.</i>) Say, how’s Uncle Jerry,
Maggie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—If you’re referring to my father, his name is
J. Ernest Neilson, so please call him Uncle Ernest. As for
myself, I detest the name of Maggie. <i>Do</i> call me Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Oh, yer rather peppery aint yer? I’m sure
Jerry is just as good a name as yer kin find anywhere.
Why, we named our old white horse that and a better horse
yer couldn’t have. As for Maggie, our black and white
spotted cow is called that and she gives more milk than any
of them. (<i>Margaret looks more and more disgusted and
Helen amused.</i>) Say, aint you going to interduce me to
your friend? At hum we always interduce everybody to
everybody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—I beg your pardon. This is my friend, Miss
Helen Montgomery. (<i>Helen raises her hand very high and
Elizabeth pulls it down and shakes it heartily.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Please ter meet you, Helly. I suspect I’ll
get real acquainted with yer before my visit’s over. Yer
don’t look quite as stuck-uppish as my cousin there. (<i>Margaret
makes a face while Helen laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—I feel greatly complimented, I’m sure. (<i>Aside</i>)
She’s summed up Margaret pretty well for a green country
girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>examining the girl’s clothes</i>) Say, girls, yer
dressed up mighty swell. Be yer going to a party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>proudly</i>) Why, no, these are just our every-day
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>in surprise</i>). You don’t say! (<i>Smoothing
down her own dress proudly.</i>) Don’t you like my new dress?
(<i>Margaret looks disdainful.</i>) I was bound to have Susannah
make it stylish and put in all the pleats and frills she could.
I think she made a real good job of it, don’t youse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>sarcastically</i>) Why, yes, I think it is beautiful
(<i>looking at Elizabeth’s hat</i>) and what a lovely hat you have
and so becoming. (<i>Turns her back to laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>getting the hat and turning it around in
her hand</i>) Yes, I think it mighty nice and so should it be
for it was awferlly expensive. I paid $1.98 for the shape
itself at (<i>names a local milliner</i>) and I trimmed it myself.
(<i>Puts it back on sofa. Helen and Margaret sit down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside</i>) It wouldn’t need a detective to make
that discovery, that’s one thing sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>unfastening satchel and taking out a gaily
colored centre-piece</i>) Now, I’ll jest set down and work at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
this centre-piece. (<i>Sits down in rocking chair and works.</i>)
I’m going to give it to you, Mag—<i>Margaret</i>, I mean, for yer
parler table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>aside</i>) Oh, gee, imagine that on our highly
polished table. I guess it will be more likely to adorn the
attic. (<i>aloud</i>) Oh, that’s very nice of you. By the way,
how did you find your way here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Oh yes, how did you when you had never been
in the city before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Well, now, I did have a mighty hard time
of it at first. I asked one of them policemen if he could
tell me where Uncle Jer—where Mr. J. Ernest Neilson
lived and he just laughed at me. (<i>She keeps rocking.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Well, I should think he would. Didn’t you know
any better than that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>still sewing</i>) Why, I was told that them
policemen could answer any kind of a question. At hum
everybody knows where everybody else lives so I thought
it would be the same here. (<i>Both girls laugh.</i>) Anyway he
asked what his address was and I showed him the top of
yer letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>in horror</i>) You didn’t show him my letter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Sure and he must have got a good squint at
what was in it, too, for he looked so funny. Well he told
me to get into one of them street car things, and the feller
who was all dressed up in brass buttons and took the tickets
told me when to get into another so it was real easy. But
I think the people here are dreadfully imperlite. They kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
giggling and giggling. I asked one what the joke was and
she grew awfully red and didn’t answer. I think it’s mighty
rude not to tell other folks the joke, why down to hum—(<i>looks
up just as the girls are turning up their noses</i>). Say,
what’s the matter with your noses? Have they nervous
twitches in them? Get a bottle of Dr. Cure-all’s syrup of
tar at (<i>name of local druggist</i>) and it will soon stop that for
it cured my cold. (<i>Rising and throwing fancy work on
chair.</i>) Laws a me, I’m awfully thirsty. Where’s the
kitchen (<i>goes towards door, Margaret starts up</i>). Never
mind coming. I’ll just use the dipper so you don’t need to
get me a glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Well, tell Nora to get you a drink. (<i>Exit
Elizabeth</i>). Oh Helen, I never saw anybody so common—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>interrupting</i>). Why she’s the most <i>un</i>common
specimen I ever met in all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>proceeding</i>)—and horrid before—and oh,
(<i>jumping up in consternation</i>), I forgot all about Edith
coming. She’ll be here soon now and I simply must get
Lizzie out of the way before she comes. Oh Helen, (<i>putting
her arm around her</i>), hurry up and think up something to
help me out of this hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside</i>), And she was so grateful when I tried
to help her the last time. But she’s in a pretty tight box now
so I guess I’ll have to try and patch it up. I wish her <i>important
ancestors</i> had given her some brains. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, tell
her—tell her—. Now let me think (<i>thinks for a minute and
suddenly grabs Margaret’s arm</i>). I have it. Tell her that
you know she must be very tired after her long journey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that you’re sure she would like to rest and have tea quietly
in her own room. Nora could take it up on a tray. Lizzie
will think it’s so considerate of you, I’m pretty sure, and the
novelty of having things sent up to her might appeal to
her. Let’s try it anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—All right. I’d try anything. (<i>Elizabeth appears.</i>)
But here she comes now. (<i>Elizabeth comes toward
centre and Margaret goes to meet her and puts her arm
around Elizabeth’s waist</i>). Oh Lizzie, I know you must be
pretty tired after your long journey. I think perhaps you
had better rest quietly until tea time. Then I’ll tell Nora
to fix you up a nice dainty tray and you’ll be under no nervous
strain at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Me tired after that speck of a ride on the
train! Why I’ve saw me walk five miles ter town and go
home and milk ten cows and not be a bit the worse for it.
And talk about nerves. Well I may be <i>nervy</i> but I aint got
them nerves that make people act like sillies. Now I’ll just
go up and put on my red chiny silk dress Susannah fixed
up that stylish with yeller bows and six frills and point de
spit lace. It will only take me a few minutes and I’ll be
down in lots of time for supper. (<i>Gets valise and goes
towards exit, then stops at one end of stage</i>), (<i>Aside</i>), I
guess it’s time that I ended this farce. I think I’ve given
my dear cousin a pretty strong jolt, judging from her face
and actions. Gee, she’s the limit all right. Anyway, I had
better change into a decent dress as I would hate to offend
Uncle Jerry—I mean <i>Uncle J. Ernest Neilson</i> (<i>exit Elizabeth</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Margaret sits moodily in chair with head propped on
knees. Helen sits toying with some fancy work.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—For goodness sake, Margaret, cheer up, you’re
not dead yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—I wish I were. What am I going to do?
and Edith is due any minute. I wonder what made Lizzie
strike today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>explosively</i>) Well, do you know, I like her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>in surprise</i>) Do you really? Well, I believe
I do myself. There’s something rather refreshing about
her and she’s so frank and good-natured. She doesn’t bear
the least grudge for that horrid letter we sent. Perhaps she
doesn’t see anything wrong with it though. Oh, whatever
made me do it? I feel as mean as dirt everytime I think of
it. I’d give anything if I had never written it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Yes, I guess it was pretty shabby, but what’s
done cannot be undone. Anyway, I don’t suppose she knows
enough to take offense at it. (<i>Starting up.</i>) Oh, I have an
idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>moodily</i>), I notice that you do catch on to
one once in a while. Well let’s hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside in disgust</i>) Now, wouldn’t that crimp
you! She couldn’t find an idea all by herself in a thousand
years. (<i>Aloud</i>). Why, I was just thinking that Lizzie
would look quite pretty if she had a decent dress to wear
and was fixed up some. Now, what’s to hinder you lending
her one of your pretty dresses and doing her hair in some
becoming fashion? I bet she wouldn’t look bad at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Why, she wouldn’t. I’ll go right up now
and do it (<i>starts toward exit</i>), or she’ll be coming down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
some awful concoction of a dress. Oh, dear, I feel awfully
nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Did you hear what she said about nerves? The
very idea, when nerves are all the go now. (<i>Bell rings</i>). Oh,
there’s Edith now. I wish she had stayed away for half
an hour longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—So do I. And however will I manage to fix
Lizzie up now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Talk for a few minutes and then excuse yourself
and I’ll entertain Edith until you come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>warmly</i>) Helen, you’re a dear and just full
of ideas. I don’t know what I’d do without you. (<i>Goes out</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside dramatically</i>), Behold the expanding of
Miss Margaret Neilson’s character. She is actually wakening
up to what I am trying to do for her and has even expressed
one grain of gratitude. Well I guess I’ll hang on to
the grain, perhaps it will sprout. (<i>Sees Lizzie’s hat and
fancy work.</i>) Goodness I’d better get these out of sight or
they’d be a sure giveaway. (<i>Runs and thrusts fancy work
under a cushion and throws hat behind couch. Margaret
appears arm in arm with Edith who is well but quietly
dressed. Helen goes to meet them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—You know Helen Montgomery don’t you,
Miss Browning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Oh call me Edith, it’s more sociable and I’ll call
you Margaret. Why yes, (<i>shaking hands with Helen</i>), I
have met you several times, haven’t I? Coming to a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
city it takes a person quite awhile to get acquainted, but I’m
managing not too badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—Why, I should say not. You have made hosts of
friends already from all accounts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Yes, everybody has been awfully kind to me and
then I’d met several people when I was at Erskine. (<i>All girls
take seats, Edith sitting where she can see the exit by turning
slightly.</i>) I hope you girls weren’t expecting me any sooner.
I had some shopping to do and that delayed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Oh, that’s all right, but we were just saying
we wish you’d hurry up so that we could have a nice, long
chat about everything before supper, so—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>interrupting</i>) Oh, Edith, do tell us about some
of the jolly times you had at Erskine College. I’m just
aching to hear about them. (<i>Draws chair closer to Edith</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Yes, please do! (<i>Draws her chair closer</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Why, I could tell you lots, but really I wouldn’t
know where to begin and once I began, I wouldn’t know
where to stop. For one thing we used to have midnight suppers
whenever one of the girls would get a box from home.
We’d all meet in one room and have nothing but candles
for a light and when we heard anyone coming, we would
have to blow them out, quick as wink. Oh, but it was exciting
when we heard any footsteps outside! There’d be a
wild scamper, I can tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen and Margaret</span>—I guess there would be. What
would you do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Everybody would grab the first thing that came
handy and we’d make ourselves as small as possible. We’d
squeeze four or five into bed with the eats and a few under
while the rest would get into a closet. One of the girls
would snore and the teacher would think she was asleep
and pass on. It was pretty hard on the eats, though, being
grabbed in such a hurry and getting all crushed up, but then
it was lots of excitement and fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—What else did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Well, we put on some pretty good amateur plays.
Beth Norton, was simply grand in anything like that. Say,
(<i>with enthusiasm</i>) you just ought to know Beth. She’s the
dearest girl out. Everybody raved over her at Erskine. She
was just bubbling over with fun and mischief and kept
things lively all the time. She was so good-hearted and kind
too and had the most forgiving nature. One girl said she
was so full of fun that there wasn’t a speck of room for
spite to lodge in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—She must be lovely. I’d like awfully well to
meet her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Well, I don’t see why you couldn’t for I just got
a letter from her and she said she was going to visit me in
a couple days. She said she was visiting some snobbish
cousin of hers who needs to be taken down a peg or two.
I’d love to see her do it, but I wouldn’t like to be the cousin,
I can tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—No, nor I either, but those people who put
on such airs ought to have it taken out of them some way
or other. I wonder who she is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—I don’t know. Beth wouldn’t think of giving her
away. (<i>Helen stares fixedly at Margaret and nods. Margaret
rises</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—I wonder if you’d excuse me for a few minutes.
I have some things I must attend to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Why of course. Don’t hurry back. (<i>Gazes at
Margaret starting to go out. Elizabeth appears at exit very
daintily dressed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—(<i>rushing past Margaret seizes Elizabeth and hugs
her</i>), Why Beth, you dear girl, (<i>pulls her towards centre</i>),
wherever did you come from? The girls were just saying
they didn’t know you. (<i>Margaret and Helen both stand in
amazement.</i>) That’s funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Oh, helloa Edith! I didn’t know you knew
my cousin. I’m just staying here until to-morrow and then
I’m going to your place for awhile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—(<i>aside in horror</i>), So this Margaret Neilson is
the snob Beth is to take down a peg. Good gracious, but
I’ve put my foot into it. (<i>Edith and Beth go to one side and
eagerly converse in low tones</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—(<i>to Helen</i>), Lizzie, Beth Norton! Why
whatever does it mean anyway? (<i>thinks</i>), How can she be
one and the same person? Oh, oh, I see it now. The names
are both nicknames and I never imagined my cousin Elizabeth
was the much talked of Beth. And so I’m the snob that
Edith said Beth was to take down a peg! (<i>Pauses</i>) And the
worst of it is I know I deserve it after that horrible letter.
I don’t deserve to have her ever speak to me again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—But, whatever did she mean by dressing up like
that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Why, don’t you see? Didn’t you say that
when she acted, she had all the professionals beaten to
pieces? Well, she’s acted that country gawk I inferred in
that letter to take me down that peg. Gee, she’s taken me
down a whole bunch of them. And oh look how we treated
her since she came. Oh, Helen, I’m so ashamed. I wish
there was a hole in the floor so that I could crawl into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>—(<i>aside</i>), Thank goodness, she’s admitted that
much. There’s hope for her yet. (<i>Aloud.</i>) We both acted
awfully mean and for my part I’m going to take my pill and
swallow it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—I will too. It’s mighty bitter, but the worse
the medicine tastes, as a rule, the better are the results. I’ll
never—(<i>Elizabeth comes up to her</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Well, Mag—Margaret, I guess it’s up to me
to explain. You see when I got your letter which showed
me so plainly that you considered any person brought up in
the country was some sort of a curiosity and nothing but
an ignoramus, I thought I would come and explain to you
that the farmers of today are among the best educated and
most wealthy people there are and their daughters are receiving
the very best advantages that can be gotten. But
when I read your letter over, I couldn’t resist the temptation
of acting the awkward gawk of a specimen you expected.
Did I succeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>—Succeed! Oh goodness, it was awful. (<i>Sinks
into a chair and starts to cry</i>), Oh, Liz—Beth, I mean. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
know I’ve been as nasty and snobbish as I could. And you
don’t know how mean I’ve felt ever since I wrote that awful,
awful letter. I’ve wished again and again that I’d never
been so rude and horrid. Will you ever forgive me? (<i>Cries</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—(<i>Putting her arm around her</i>), Oh, cheer up,
Margaret, of course I’ll forgive you; you just need some of
your notions changed. That’s all. And when it comes to forgiving,
perhaps I’d better ask you to forgive me for playing
such a trick on you. (<i>Aside, laughing</i>), But, gee it was the
best fun I’ve had for ages. Their shocked faces! (<i>laugh</i>),
their turned up noses, (<i>laughs</i>), their open disgust. Oh
glory, it was worth a circus to see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith</span>—Well, let’s forget everything that’s been done
and said and begin all over again. I think we’ll be great
friends. Let’s shake over it. (<i>She takes Helen’s hand, Elizabeth
takes Margaret’s and they stand with crossed hands in
front of stage</i>).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>—Oh girls, see how our hands are crossed; I
wonder who’s going to be married first.</p>

given in any schoolroom by any number. Easy to produce. Costumes simple.
Children and grown-ups will be delighted with CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN
HOLLER. Price, 15 cents.</p>

Elizabeth F. Guptill. It is decidedly humorous from start to finish. The
characters are strong and at every turn of the play there is a happy surprise
for the audience. The children are tired of “minding,” and the everything being
“just so,” so they start to find a place where they will find things different.
They find it in Topsy Turvy Land, where they have strange experiences.
When at last they have a Topsy Turvy Christmas, they are ready to go home
and be satisfied with things just as they are. May be given in any schoolroom
by any number of children not less than fifteen. In two short scenes.

sparkling humor. Several nationalities are represented in the tenement and
there is opportunity for the introduction of specialties if desired. Circumstances
cause Elsie, the tenement orphan, to believe Jimmy, the newsboy, will
buy her a Christmas present, and it seems it is up to Jimmy to do it. Christmas
is an unknown quantity at the tenement, but all agree that Elsie must not
be disappointed, and plan to have one somehow. The entertainment is given
by the “inhabitints thimsilves,” at McCarthy’s. In the midst of the fun,
Elsie’s lost father walks in, and the finale is a general rejoicing. Price, 25c.</p>

After a spectacular drill and fancy march they all sing a beautiful Christmas
song, which accompanies the drill. Following the song they wind a spiral to

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
